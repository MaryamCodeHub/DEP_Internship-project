This Python project implements the Red-Blue Nim Game, where players take turns removing 1 or 2 marbles from red or blue piles. The game supports both "standard" and "misere" versions, allowing players to choose who goes first (human or computer) and adjust the AI difficulty with a customizable search depth. The AI uses a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make strategic moves. The game can be played in the terminal with options provided via command-line arguments.
